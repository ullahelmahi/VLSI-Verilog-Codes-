# FSM Code Repository

This repository contains an implementation of a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**. The FSM is designed to simulate state transitions based on input events and is useful for modeling control systems, workflow engines, protocol handlers, and more.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Customizable state and event definitions
- Easy-to-read transition logic
- Expandable for more complex FSM scenarios
- Written in Verilog HDL
